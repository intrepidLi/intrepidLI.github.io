I'm a BEng student at Beihang University, majoring in Computer Science and Technology. I'm now interested in the fields of artifical intelligence. I'd like to make computer understand human language better and help people solve problems in their daily life. Here is my [English CV](uploads/resume_en.pdf) and [Chinese CV](uploads/resume_zh.pdf). I'm currently looking for a PhD position in Computer Science. If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me.
